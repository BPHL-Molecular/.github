# Florida BPHL's Bioinformatics pipelines and various code

- 👋 Hi, we're a group of bioinformaticians and data analysts at Florida's Bureau of Public Health Laboratories!
- 👩‍💻 We are active members of [StaPH-B](https://staphb.org/ "StaPH-B Homepage") and use many of the [StaPH-B resources](https://github.com/StaPH-B "StaPH-B Github") and [docker builds](https://github.com/StaPH-B/docker-builds "StaPH-B Docker builds") for our pipelines!
- 🌱 We are currently in the process of updating all our pipelines to Nextflow
- 💞️ We are always interested to collaborate on public health bioinformatics tools and workflows for the investigation of infectious diseases.
